Why is version / source control important?

Version/source code is important because it is important to track the change you make to a project. It is also useful when you are working in a team and collaborating on the same project.  Using a version/source control can keep track to who makes what changes and when.  It allow multiple people to work on the same files with out overwriting their work.
