Why is version / source control important?

Version/source code is important because it is important to track the change you make to a project. It is also useful when you are working in a team and collaborating on the same project.  Using a version/source control can keep track to who makes what changes and when.  It allow multiple people to work on the same files with out overwriting their work.  If there is ever an issue with what you are working on you can alwasy revert the latest commits and go back to an older version.  There is definately a learning curve when using verson/source code software but once you get a base foundation of how they work there will be a huge benefit to it.
